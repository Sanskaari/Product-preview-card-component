### What I learned

I made this project majorly to put my TailwindCSS skills to test. Learned to create responsive designs using TailwindCSS. Learned to create custom styles in TailwindCSS and add custom fonts as well.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This helped me to look for different CSS properties in TailwindCSS.
- [TailwindCSS Play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/) - This is an amazing in-browser editor for testing your TailwindCSS styles on the go.
